Got an optical overview of control samples in [[AFM sample box]]. protocol:
- do not load an AFM probe
- focus on sample
- set light intensity to 20% and gain/exposure to auto
- go around sample to take pictures

Protocol for inclusion body measurements:
- load and equilibrate tip
- find a region with cells
- take optical image
- calibrate AFM-IR on epoxy (for a more reproducible benchmark)

Data from control 4:
- collecting spectra with varying pulse widths to find the optimal one, see notebook
  - `sample 4 pulse width tune`
  - `sample 4 pulse width tune 2`
  - `sample 4 pulse width tune 3`
  - ~~todo: ask ADB what this data could mean~~
- ir images
  - `sample 4 ir images`: 1625, 1650, 1660, 1740
- ir spectra
  - `sample 4 ir spectra`: spectra at predefined locations with 
    - PLL IP=4/10
    - pulse width=160
    - coaverages=5
  - large spectral range
    - first, take a spectrum to define good spots for IR optimisation
      - chip 1: 1660 (amide 1)
      - chiop 2:  1260 (silicon)
      - chip 3: 1088 (?)
      - chip 4: 914
      - chip edges: 1803, 1440, 1195, 987, 762
    - then, a spectral array
      - PLL IP 4/1
      - image every spectrum, auto drift corr and force reset enabled
        - first drift val is about 2nm/min, then 16nm/min, 33
        - software started acting up, so had to reboot anasys studio
      - then again
        - note that automatic drift correction did not perform as hoped
        - spectral variation is meaningful, but basically uncorrelated to location
